One of the best pieces of advice I was ever given about managing my money was from a boss at a
previous job. I had just been informed I was getting a spontaneous raise of of about 15%. He
suggested that I simply pretend I didn't get the raise, and put the extra money away for retirement.

Being a few years younger and not having realized that I would, in fact, get older at some point, I didn't
listen and decided to find a more expensive apartment instead. In retrospect, I really did make the wrong choice
considering the past few years have seen doulbe digit market growth. Plus the new apartment had bad neighbors and
a total lack of anything to do in walking distance.

The simple solution is to live like you make less than you do.
